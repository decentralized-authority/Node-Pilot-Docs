Node Pilot is still in Alpha and is not meant for production use. It is being released for testing purposes only.
{% endhint %}

Node Pilot run with the follow command from the terminal:

```bash
./np
```

_(If you are using Ubuntu Desktop, closing the terminal instance will close the Node Pilot as well.)_

The terminal _will_ let you know when the GUI web server has started and will give your Local IP address and Public IP address to access the Node Pilot GUI:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (36).png>)

When you access the GUI for the first time, you will need to accept the self-signed TSL certificate that Node Pilot automatically generates.

![CLICK "Advanced" and then "Proceed to..."](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png>)
