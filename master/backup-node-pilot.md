# Backups

Node Pilot is designed so you can easily backup your configs, keys, and certificates.

**IMPORTANT**: These backups do include Key Passwords in plain text. It is advised that if your backups include Mainnet Validators, the backups should only be stored on trusted encrypted systems.
{% endhint %}

Click "BACKUP" to download a backup ZIP of your config folder. If your backup includes Pocket nodes, the file could be many gigabytes which will take a few minutes before the download begins.
