# Logs

Node Pilot captures logs from a number of places.

In the filesystem, logs are stored in `./.node-pilot/config/logs`

Within the GUI, you can view the logs by clicking the logs icon on the top right of the screen

Logs for specific chain and validator nodes can be seen in the details page for each node.
