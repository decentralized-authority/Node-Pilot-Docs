Node Pilot makes upgrading nodes to validator nodes as simple as a few clicks. Pocket Validators are some of the most complex nodes in the crypto space, and with Node Pilot, the validator process is a single click.

Node Pilot can handle any validation process. Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/W9CrDBB44U) to let us know what validator we should add next.
