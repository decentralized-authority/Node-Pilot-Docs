# Importing from another Wallet

NodeWallet was designed to be able to import the seed phrases from any wallet using the BIP-32 standard. This includes the majority of wallets like:

* MetaMask
* SendWallet
* Ledger
* Trezor
* Taho Wallet
* Rabby Wallet

This means you can use your seed phrase from another wallet to generate POKT addresses in NodeWallet. No need to have a POKT specific seed phrase if you already use another extension wallet.
